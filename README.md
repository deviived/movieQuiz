# movieQuiz

I create movieQuiz to learn the basics of android development.

It's a quiz app based on a tutorial you can find on [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4661936-develop-your-first-android-application)

I added some functionalities, and I hadn't finish the quiz app yet like I would it to be.

I plan to had a lot of things like the possibility to play in a asynchronous way with friends online, voices, animations...
